is the first official release of the [Go-powered hub](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/475). It marks the milestone of rewriting hub in Go by merging in [jingweno/gh](https://github.com/jingweno/gh) :tada:.\n\nOn [April 2013](https://github.com/jingweno/gh/commit/d5615fcb6f9c983fbf5d1297700a26531ddf1173), gh was started as a hobby project and as a taste of using Go for a command-line tool. Go has proven itself to be a solid solution for a CLI application with the benefit of [speed, low memory usage and ease of distribution](http://owenou.com/2013/12/22/fast-github-command-line-client-written-in-go.html).\n\nWe learned a lot from the rewrite. One important takeaway was that the [hub cucumber specs](https://github.com/github/hub/tree/master/features) have played an **important role** in making sure existing behaviors are not broken. We can't stress enough the value of and show appreciation for the existence of these language independent specs.\n\nWe :heart: this release and hope you'll too. Here's a list of bug fixes since [2.2.0-rc1](https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc1):\n- Properly parse global git flags: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/764\n- Fork command on GitHub Enterprise prompts with incorrect hostname: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/770\n- Fix Windows config file directory issue: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/773\n- Fix `hub checkout <PULLREQ-URL>` for renamed fork: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/776\n- Compilation on OpenBSD: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/779\n- Support `hub init -g DIR`: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/791\n- Read title and body by taking into account Windows line endings: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/806\n- Do not insert \"--no-ff\" for \"--squash\" for `hub-merge`: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/807\n- Doc improvement on `hub browse`: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/759\n- Bug fixes on help message of `hub issue -l`: https://github.com/github/hub/pull/750\n\nLast but not least, we would like to thank our [contributors](https://github.com/github/hub/graphs/contributors?from=2014-02-14&to=2015-02-14&type=c) :sparkles:.

is the first preview release of the [Go-powered hub](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/475). This marks a milestone where the rewrite of hub in Go that lived in [jingweno/gh](https://github.com/jingweno/gh) now became the main implementation.\n\n**Why Go?** The problem with writing a command-line tool in Ruby is that [it's very difficult to make it fast](https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v1.11.1), and Ruby is required to be installed on the system for it to work. The Go executable is **both fast and easy to install**, since it bundles its own runtime.\n\nThe new implementation should be fully backwards compatible.

This can happen when a user forks a project but already has a repository of the same name.\n- Use non-predictable filename for downloaded patch file\n  \n  Since the /tmp directory is readable by everybody on Unix, and since the patch name could be public or easy to guess, a attacker could create a symlink to a file writable by the user running hub, which would be replaced by the patch.\n  \n  This has been assigned CVE-2014-0177.\n- Fix API 422 error: `Duplicate value for \"description\"`\n- Fix \"invalid byte sequence\" errors in `pull-request`\n  \n  If the user's `LANG` environment variable doesn't include \"UTF-8\", the default external encoding in Ruby will be US-ASCII and as such, string operations will fail dealing with pull request message or changelog that\n  contains non-ASCII characters.\n- Respect git \"core.commentchar\" setting in `pull-request` message\n- Fix displaying output of `hub --noop pull-request`\n  \n  In attempts to make multi-page output from hub get cleared when exiting the pager in the terminal, I've broken outputting short bits of text such as `--noop` output, which would accidentally get swallowed.

I will revisit this in the future.\n- Don't re-wrap default pull request message taken from commit\n  \n  Re-wrapping to 78 chars was dangerous since it could lead to moving a #-reference to the beginning of a line which would then get interpreted as a comment.\n\n![rtnrxzd](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/887/3065526/1d2ea8f8-e264-11e3-9878-274d0a1c18e4.gif)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205245","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205245/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205245/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v1.11.2","id":205245,"tag_name":"v1.11.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"hub 1.11.2","draft":false,"author":{"login":"mislav","id":887,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/887?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav","html_url":"https://github.com/mislav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2014-02-02T17:22:23Z","published_at":"2014-03-01T00:28:17Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/tarball/v1.11.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/zipball/v1.11.2","body":"- Fix `hub browse` destination when on the master branch\n- Fix hub when a remote has local path instead of URL\n- Fix for `hub fork` for rare cases where the fork is not year ready to be `git fetch`ed\n- Improve extracting title & body in `pull-request`\n- Escape slashes in `hub compare` URLs with semicolon\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205242","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205242/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/205242/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v1.12.0","id":205242,"tag_name":"v1.12.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"hub 1.12.0","draft":false,"author":{"login":"mislav","id":887,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/887?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav","html_url":"https://github.com/mislav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2014-03-01T00:09:27Z","published_at":"2014-03-01T00:25:30Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/tarball/v1.12.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/zipball/v1.12.0","body":"Features:\n- `hub pull-request -o` (`--browse`) to open the new pull request in the browser\n- Support Enterprise over non-secure HTTP via `protocol` option in `~/.config/hub`\n- Enable API debug output by setting HUB_VERBOSE environment variable\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix reusing old OAuth tokens stored in Authorizations API\n- Allow help pager to clear screen on exit\n- Avoid mispelled `pull-request` flags getting misinterpreted as title\n- Rescue HTTP exceptions during `ci-status` command\n\n![marceline3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/887/2299945/207fbc7a-a0da-11e3-9bbe-797a8ad13c6b.gif)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/131605","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/131605/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/131605/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v1.11.1","id":131605,"tag_name":"v1.11.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"hub 1.11.1 -

Version 1.11.0 made hub _much_ faster compared to previous versions; **this release makes it even faster**.\n\nThis benchmark on Ruby 2.0.0-p247 demonstrates a **63 ms speedup** for the `hub browse` command:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=2></th>\n<th>mean (s)</th>\n<th>stdev (s)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=2><code>hub browse -u</code></th>\n<th>v1.11.0</th>\n<td>0.134</td>\n<td>0.007</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>v1.11.1</th>\n<td><strong>0.071<strong></td>\n<td>0.004</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/887/1809246/990ed90e-6dc8-11e3-9a1d-f6ece880608b.gif)\n\nThe speed gains were available in several areas:\n- When shelling out to git, hub used to silence stderr like so: ``cmd 2>/dev/null``. Turns out, the mere presence of shell redirection syntax added a few milliseconds per call. Now there is no shell redirection, and hub simply silences `STDERR` from Ruby.\n- Reduce the number of shelling out to git across the board. Each `git` invocation takes 5–7 ms, and since we did that a lot, it added a lot of overhead at runtime. When possible, some shelling out was replaced by simply inspecting the files under the `.git/` directory. In other cases, duplicate and similar calls were consolidated, and necessary calls are now done lazily, only when absolutely needed.\n- Reduced features in SshConfig, which is an `ssh_config(5)` parser that we use for resolving ssh aliases to full hostnames. SshConfig did too much and used to implement features that we never took advantage of, so I reduced it to a bare minimum which greatly increased parsing speed.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/129369","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/129369/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/github/hub/releases/129369/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v1.11.0","id":129369,"tag_name":"v1.11.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"hub 1.11 – codename “What Was Missing”","draft":false,"author":{"login":"mislav","id":887,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/887?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav","html_url":"https://github.com/mislav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mislav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2013-12-22T01:16:10Z","published_at":"2013-12-22T01:24:42Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/tarball/v1.11.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hub/zipball/v1.11.0","body":"The long-awaited release of hub is here! You spoke and I listened. Needless to say, this is the best release of hub ever.\n\n[hub is a command-line wrapper](http://hub.github.com) for `git` executable that extends it with features that improve integration with GitHub.\n\nTo install hub:\n- Install from source:\n  \n  ``` sh\n  git clone https://github.com/github/hub.git\n  cd hub\n  rake install prefix=/usr/local\n  \n  # run and follow the instructions:\n  hub alias\n  ```\n- Upgrade with Homebrew:\n  \n  ```\n  brew upgrade hub\n  ```\n\n### It's _faster_. Algebraic!\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/887/1796954/3e75581a-6a99-11e3-94e6-2e428e68ae3e.gif)\n\nhub is written in Ruby and its execution time was abysmal. It kinda sucks that you're supposed to wrap `git` with a tool that's an order of magnitude slower than git itself. Well, the good news is that I've made it much faster in the new release:\n\nv1.10.6:\n- `hub version` - mean: 0.138 ms\n- `hub browse -u` - mean: 0.191 ms\n\nv1.11.0:\n- `hub version` - mean: 0.062 ms (**76 ms faster**)\n- `hub browse -u` - mean: 0.131 ms (**60 ms faster**)\n\nI've done that by:\n- `--disable-gems` flag to the Ruby interpreter to skip loading RubyGems;\n- avoiding loading `fileutils` and `cgi` modules, and reimplemented the few methods I need from them;\n- avoiding loading `yaml` and `uri` modules, which are slow to load, and implemented a rudimentary YAML serializer/deserializer to handle hub configuration, and a replacement URI::HTTP class which handles simple URLs.\n\n### Ready to squish some long-outstanding issues?\n- **Enable two-factor authentication** (2FA) and email-based GitHub Enterprise login.\n- **Detect default branch** if named something other than \"master\", e.g. \"develop\". If the default branch is not picked up by git automatically on clone, you can explicitly set it once per repo with `git remote set-head REMOTE BRANCH`.\n- **Detect origin remote** when named something other than \"origin\", e.g. \"upstream\" or \"github\".\n- **Enable cloning of private repos** without having to use `hub clone -p`. hub will use the ssh protocol instead of git protocol for any repo that is private or that you have push access to.\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/887/1796955/502c7c8c-6a99-11e3-947e-cdfbeb0523e7.gif)\n\n### I'm frikkin’ _all about_ pull-request!\n- **Improve detecting the implicit head** of the pull request. For example, if you have push access to the main repository and you created a branch on it, `git pull-request` will no longer incorrectly assume that the head should be the same-named branch on your (possibly non-existent) fork.\n- Add **support for passing the pull request title & body** via command line, file, or standard input via the `-m MESSAGE` or `-F FILE` parameters that match those supported by `git commit`.\n- **Deprecate converting issues** into pull requests. This functionality is likely to be dropped from GitHub's API.\n- Save and reuse `pull-request` message if creating one failed.\n- Avoid hard breaks in `pull-request` message authored in Vim.\n\n### New `ci-status` command. Mathematical!\n\n`hub ci-status` provides access to GitHub Status API and is useful for checking the outcome of CI builds. It prints the status string on standard output and exits with a non-zero code for any status other than \"success\". This can be useful in shell scripts, e.g. to abort pushing a release if CI is pending or failing.\n\n``` sh\n$ hub ci-status\nsuccess\n\n$ hub ci-status mybranch\npending\n\n$ hub ci-status >/dev/null && rake release\n```\n\n### Other improvements\n- `hub am`: enable fetching pull request and commit patches from private repos\n- Improve zsh and bash shell completions (and even added to CI test suite!)\n- Escape complex branch names in `browse` URLs\n- Allow `--ff-only` in `merge <PULL-URL>`\n- Display `hub help hub` using all available width of the terminal\n- `hub version` includes commit SHA when built from git\n- Fix reading from git `core.pager` when the value contains spaces\n- Expand environment variables in git `core.editor` value\n- Skip reading `ssh_config` when no read privileges\n- Lock down to GitHub API v3 for guarding against future changes of their API\n\n### Thanks to the contributors :heart: :sparkles:\n\nLadios Jonquil, Dave Goodell, Adam Spiers, Yasuharu Ozaki, Timothy Gu, Tekkub, Stuart Nelson, Steven Harman, Shay Frendt, Mindaugas Mozūras, Mike Dougherty, Michiel Sikkes, Maksim Ryzhikov, Lukas Zapletal, Kirill Müller, John Manoogian III, Jo Liss, Jamie Wright, Ivan Tse, Haukur Páll Hallvarðsson, Glenn Gentzke, David Mai, Arturo Herrero, Aaron Stacy.
